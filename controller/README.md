Commander Knight-Owl's Odyssey Controls
===============================================================================

Definately a work in progress, built for Odyssey's v4.0 bindings. My goal's to make the first person stuff a lot like Halo because that's what I'm used to.



SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy or hardlink the `.vdf` files from the `steam` directory to `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\299579286\241100\remote\2427073884_controller_config.vdf"` Where those numbers are, you'll need to use the ones unique to your setup.

2. Copy the `.binds` files from the `elite` directory to the Elite Dangerous folder at `%localappdata%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings`


See main README for details.
