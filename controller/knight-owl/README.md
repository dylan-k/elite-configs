Commander Knight-Owl's Odyssey Controls
===============================================================================

Definately a work in progress, built for Odyssey's v4.0 bindings. My goal's to make the first person stuff a lot like Halo because that's what I'm used to.



SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy or hardlink the `.vdf` file to `<steam folder>/userdata/<your user number>/241100/remote/controller_config/<steam app id>/2427073884_controller_config.vdf`
(Or use `steam://controllerconfig/xxx/yyy`)
2. Copy the `.4.0.binds` file to the Elite Dangerous folder at `%localappdata%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings`


See main README for details.
