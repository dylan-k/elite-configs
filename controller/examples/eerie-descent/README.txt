Eerie Descent's Controller Config for Elite Damgerous
===============================================================================

### default action set

gyro

activate on right pad touch: mouse pitch/yaw on the steam controller's pitch/yaw. i used to fly this with pitch/roll, and it felt very good, but i found yaw to be too necessary for fixed weapon aiming and required finer controls than i could get elsewhere.

left pad

left joystick move. i use this as forward/reverse thrust in flight, and as l/r steering in the srv. yes, i'm only using one axis at a time, since it doesn't need more.

click is for boost in flight, or turret mode in the srv.

i use a variant of u/mennenth's edge tap technique that works for joystick mode to set it to a d-pad for controller up/down/left/right for quick menu navigation and pip management

when left bumper is held, adjust throttle (needed in supercruise): up/down for forward/reverse increments, outer ring binding for 100%/0%, click for 75%.

right pad

lateral and vertical thrusters

headlook mode while the pad is being held down (i used to toggle on click, but in the heat of combat i'd too often accidentally click it and lose mouse control of my ship. when i have to hold it down i can just release it and go back to what i wanted to do)

left/right trigger

roll left/right. unfortunately, elite requires this to be digital if you can't supply a single continuous axis for roll. i've tried workarounds like using the (currently unused) left-pad l/r axis bound to the triggers, and while that works it caused too many other problems in game, specifically with how i like to drive the srv.

while in srv mode: forward throttle on right trigger, reverse throttle on left.

left/right bumper

page left/right in menus.

various chording actions set up by default in elite, plus the one mode shift above for throttle controls on the left pad.

analog stick

toggle panels: left for nav, up for comms, down for helm, right for ship

click to switch to the next actiion set, which i use where i want mouse on the right pad (like fss) but can't auto-switch because there's no mouse cursor present

face buttons

nothing special

left/right grip

primary weapons fire on right grip, secondary on left. this may be more natural on the triggers, but is a holdover from my flight assisted days when i needed the dual stage triggers for other stuff. it works well enough here, so i haven't bothered to change it.

### menu action set

this is set to turn on automatically when the mouse is visible.

nb: elite doesn't auto-show the mouse in menus, but since i have gyro on right pad touch (which is also the mouse in this mode) it normally shows up anyway just because the gyro wiggles the mouse a bit and that activates the cursor in-game. you will probably notice in things like the galaxy map that your first mouse swipe will slightly rotate the map before the cursor appears. it's not a big deal to me, but worth pointing out.

gyro

activate on right pad touch for mouse. set up with up/down/left/right on steam controller pitch/yaw.

left pad

scroll wheel

right pad

mouse

left/right trigger

left mouse click on right trigger soft pull, right mouse click on left trigger soft pull

left/right bumper

n/a

analog stick

controller d-pad up/down/left/right. i only use this while in fss mode to move frequencies

click to switch to next action set (which is the default, since there's only 2, but in case i add more, i like clicking the stick to rotate between them consistenttly)

face buttons

a button is space bar, to select things

b button is backspace, to back out of menus

left/right grip

n/a

### flight assisted

the main change here is with using the triggers for throttle:

throttle forward/reverse increments on right/left trigger soft pulls, respectively

throttle 0%/50% on right/left full pulls, respectively. 50% because that's your most maneuverable in normal flight

throttle -100%/100% on right/left double-full pulls, respectively. tbh, i didn't use this much, and forward 75% may be better for use in supercruise.

because triggers are handling throttle, instead of roll, roll is on the left pad left/right axis.
