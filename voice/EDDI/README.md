I have EDDI installed as a VoiceAttack plugin, and Voiceattack is installed via Steam. THere are other install configs possible so these are the important paths:


path to exe:  
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\VoiceAttack\Apps\elite-dangerous-data-interface\EDDI.exe"

config files:  
%APPDATA%\Roaming\EDDI  

eddi.json and /personalities should be installed in the config files directory.
