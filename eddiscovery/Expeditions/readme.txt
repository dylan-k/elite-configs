You can use multiple Expeditions files, all *.json will be read.

Use a blank file to remove an older one from a user computer.. folder is not cleaned before each load

Use a DeletedExpeditions.json to list the deleted ones..

Empty systems list will delete the entry from the user computer.. Use practically never. Only if an expedition has been withdrawn
