Configs for EliteG19s
===============================================================================

The EliteG19s app uses the `%AppData%\EliteG19s\options.json` file to store its options. 

This is a json file which has a specific notation. Feel free to use a JSON validator to check you haven't made any typos before saving any changes to the options file.

Symlink the `options.json `file here in place of `%AppData%\EliteG19s\options.json` to keep it under backup and version control with this git repository.
