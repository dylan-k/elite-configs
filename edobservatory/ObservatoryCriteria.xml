<!-- Auto-generated Observatory Criteria Sample File -->
<!-- 
	Element: ObservatoryCriteria
		All criteria are contained withing a single root ObservatoryCriteria element,
		this is required and there must be only one. 
	
	Element: Criteria
		Inside the ObservatoryCriteria can be any number of Criteria elements,
		each of which must have a Comparator attribute and depending on the 
		comparator used, up to two value attributes.
		Value Comparators are "Greater", "Less", "Equal", and "Between".
		"Between" comparisons require LowerValue and UpperValue attributes, 
		while all others use only a single Value.
		Logical Comparators without values are "And", "Or", and "Not".
		
		Each Criteria element must contain one Operation and one Description,
		and optionally one Detail element.
		For value comparison criteria the result of the Operation element is
		tested against the criteria's comparator and value and is added to
		Observatory's list of interesting bodies if the criteria is met.
		For logical criteria the operator specified is applied to additional
		Criteria elements nested within before any of them are added to the list.
		
		Description and Detail are ignored inside nested criteria for logical
		operations. Only the top level description and detail are used.
	
	Element: Operation
		Operation elements describe mathematical to perform	on event values,
		static numbers, or the results of other operations.
		Each Operation must have a Operator attribute, being one of "Multiply",
		"Divide", "Add", "Subtract", or "None".
		
		The Operation element must contain up to two elements, FirstValue and
		SecondValue. The "None" operation uses only FirstValue, passing it's
		value unchanged, while all others require both. FirstValue and SecondValue
		are explictly ordered in this fashion to preserve the order of operands
		for subtraction and division.
	
	Element: FirstValue and SecondValue
		All value elements must have a Type attribute, which can be "Number",
		"EventData", or "Operation".
		
		Number values contain a simple numeric value to be used by the operation.
		
		EventData values are used to get data from the scan event being processed.
		The details are found below.
			
		Operation values contain a single Operation element, the result of which
		is used as a value in the containing operation. Operations can be nested in
		this manner without limit, to create mathematical formulae of arbitrary
		complexity.
	
	Value Type: EventData
		Indicates the scan event data you want to use for a FirstValue or SecondValue
		element. All quantities are in the original units used by the journal file.
		
		Valid values are:
		
			DistanceFromArrivalLS
			TidalLock
			TerraformState
			Atmosphere
			Volcanism
			MassEM
			Radius
			SurfaceGravity
			SurfaceTemperature
			SurfacePressure
			Landable
			SemiMajorAxis
			Eccentricity
			OrbitalInclination
			Periapsis
			OrbitalPeriod
			RotationPeriod
			AxialTilt
			StellarMass
			AbsoluteMagnitude
			Age_MY
			WasDiscovered
			WasMapped
			Rings
			PlanetClass:{Class Name}
			Parent:{Parent Body Event Data}
            AtmosphereType:{Type}
		    AtmosphereComposition:{Element}
		    ParentType:{n}:{Type}
			
		TerraformState, Atmosphere, and Volcanism return a simple 1 or 0 if they
		are populated, there is not currently a means to check for specific atmosphere
		or volcanism types. This may change in a later version.
		
		PlanetClass checks for a specific body type, as provided after the ":". The
		class must be an exact case-insensitive match for the class text found in the
		journal file. For example "PlanetClass:Sudarsky class V gas giant".
		
		Rings returns a simple count of the number of rings a body has. Details of those
		rings are not yet available. This may change in a later version.
		
		Parent looks for the parent body's scan event and if found will check for the
		corresponding value, e.g., "Parent:MassEM". Parent data can be extended
		indefinitely if you need data for the parent's parent, or deeper if desired,
		e.g., "Parent:Parent:Parent:PlanetClass:Earthlike Body".
		NOTE: Parent data is only available if the parent is scanned before the child
		body. Checks that rely on parent data will fail to trigger if child bodies
		are scanned first.

        AtmosphereType returns 1 if the type scanned matches the type provided, otherwise
	    returns 0, e.g., "AtmosphereType: CarbonDioxide".


        AtmosphereComposition gets the percentage amount of the specified element, e.g.,
	    "AtmosphereCompsotion:Argon".


        ParentType checks the nth parent body type against the type specificed(options

        "Planet", "Star", and "Null") and returns 1 for a match, or 0 otherwise, e.g.,
        "ParentType:1:Planet".

    Element: Description
		Contains simple text which is displayed in Observatory's description column.
		
	Element: Detail
		Contains any number of Item elements to display the values of in Observatory's
		detail column, so that the numbers behind the criteria checks can be seen by
		the user, if desired.
		This element is optional.
		
	Element: Item
		Contains the scan event item you want to display the details of. Used in the
		same manner as the EventData value type, with the same valid values, with the
		exception of PlanetClass, which does not require a specific class to be
		specified.
